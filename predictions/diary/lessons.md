# pump-prediction skill — rolling lessons & smart-wallet registry

This file is the persistent memory of the `pump-prediction` skill.

Every Phase 1 (audit) invocation may update this file; every Phase 2
(decide) invocation reads it. The frontmatter above tracks the rolling
hit-rate stats that drive the 7-day learning health check.

**During cold-start** (the first ~10 invocations), the Validated lessons
section is empty and the smart-wallet registry has no data. The skill
falls back to the bootstrap heuristics defined in
`.claude/skills/pump-prediction.md`.

# Validated lessons (status: VALIDATED, ≥3 confirms — input to every Phase 2)

_(none yet — populated by Phase 1 audits)_

# Candidate lessons (status: CANDIDATE, 1–2 audits, pending confirmation)

_(none yet)_

# Smart-wallet registry (auto-maintained, top-30 by winner_hits)

| wallet | winner_hits | total_appearances | precision | last_seen |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| _(none yet)_ | | | | |

# Disconfirmed signals (status: DISCONFIRMED — anti-patterns)

## D1 — High Telegram mention count alone
Tested as "if mentioned ≥10× across channels in 12h → BUY." Result expected: poor precision (Telegram channels are mostly shillers / pump-and-dump organizers). Status: DISCONFIRMED a priori (pre-seeded based on the spec's risk discussion). The skill MUST corroborate Telegram mentions with on-chain trade flow before raising conviction.

# Notes

- Format: every lesson has a frontmatter triple `status / confirms / disconfirms / last_confirmed_at`.
- State transition rules are defined in the skill file at `.claude/skills/pump-prediction.md`.
- Smart-wallet registry inclusion: `winner_hits >= 3` AND `precision >= 0.25`.
- Pruning: wallets with `last_seen > 30 days ago` are dropped.
- This file is COMMITTED to git; per-run decision/outcome files are gitignored.
